"A face I've never seen before, how intriguing. Who are you?"
<I'm me?>[Introspective]
<I just got here.>[New Face]
<...>[NoProgressEnd]

[Introspective]
"And who, exactly, is 'me'? Such a fascinating answer."
"Its as if you are just starting a grand tale, before the Hero's Journey has begun..."
"...so what brings you here?"
<I don't want to talk about it.>[Brush off] 
<Melancholy and a wish to get out of it.>[Melancholy] 
<Who are you?!>[Storytellers' introduction] 

[Brush off]
"Ah, we've nothing to talk about then. I guess I'll focus on my own journey then."
"Got other climbers to record and more stories to tell."
<'Stories to tell'?>[Story Time]
<*Leave them and say goodbye*>[NoProgressEnd]

[Story Time]
"Ah yes, I'm a storyteller. I tell the stories of the many climbers in here."
"Many of us face these challenges, and I record them."
<Can you tell me about any of them?>[The Veteran]
<Aren't you also a climber?>[Storytellers' introduction]

[New Face]
"Exciting! A new chapter is added to the story of the Tower..."
"A new beginning and a story of your own, to unfold in the many directions that the tower can go."
"A new face to the story and to me, I welcome you to the Tower of Smoke"
<Yeah... I don't really feel welcome here...>[Welcome]
<Thank you, but who are you?>[The Storytellers' introduction]

[Welcome]
"Not a lot of us do, I'm afraid. It is a bit, unwelcoming in here and we do all struggle..."
"Not like that matters much. What matters is what is at the top of the tower."
<*Nod* My melancholy is not making it easier.>[Melancholy]
<Climbing the tower is all that matters...>[Tower will Tell]

[Melancholy]
"Melancholy and the struggle out of it..."
"There are others like that in this tower, stories I can tell you of course."
<Tell me one of those stories.>[The Veteran]
<Tell me more about yourself.>[Storytellers' introduction]

[The Veteran]
"A sad story. A story of a fighter just like you or I" 
"A man of many adventures, both before the tower and inside of it"
"The Audacious Veteran is who I will tell you about!"
"*They open their Journal, smiling*"
<*Keep listening in silence*>[VeteranCont]
<The Veteran?>[VeteranCont]

[VeteranCont]
"Indeed! He was here long before I came. He had encountered horrors beyond even my imagination."
"A soul ravaged by war and conflict, but somehow able to constantly keep on fighting."
"Let's see... The story of how he fought the Keeper of Despair might be a fitting one. What do you think?"
<That sounds... intersting.>[TheKeeper]
<'The Keeper of Despair'?>[TheKeeper] 

[TheKeeper] 
"Within the Tower there are many wardens. Each one unique."
"One of the more prominent ones is the Keeper of Despair" 
"A vicious creature feeding off of anguish and fear, as its name entails."
"An architect of anguish that claws at your sanity the moment you see it." 
"The veteran entered its halls. A giant shrine of stone, held up by the desperate."
"Those that take solace in their misery, wallowing in their mental pain."
"They pray at its altar, which only increases its power."
"The Veteran walked up to its altar and smashed it with a mailed fist, challenging the beast."
"As the veteran looked around, the swirling darkness around him thickened." 
"The shrine's walls pushing in around him as the horrendous avatar of the warden appeared."
"As the creature crawled out through the darkness the Veteran readied himself"
"Lifting his crossbow to his shoulder, aiming towards the creature..."
<*Keep listening in silence*>[KeeperCont]
<*nod*>[KeeperCont] 
<*Look sceptically at the Storyteller*>[Disbelief]

[KeeperCont]
"As the creature emerges from the shadows its two long sinewy arms claw at the ground with long blade-like nails"
"The shape of the creature is barely recognizable as human, too uncanny and malformed. Torn apart from the prayers of despair" 
"The Veteran fires at it, releasing a heavy bolt from his crossbow, striking the keeper in the shoulder."
"As the creature shrieks, the veteran rolls in behind the Altar and he starts reloading his crossbow."
"The creature violently strikes the altar...tearing it to pieces."
"With only a split second left before the keeper of despair reaches him, he fires once more."
"The bolt striking true, as the creature twists in agony. The veteran drops his crossbow, striking at the creature with his fists."
"Pummeling the Keeper of Despair again and again, until it lashes out, launching the veteran through the room and into on of the walls of the temple."
"The veteran rises to his feet. He readies himself for the approaching beast, taking a drink from his wineskin."
"With reinvigorated courage, he strikes out again, fist against claws."
"A crack is heard. The bones in the creatures arms shattering as the Veteran readies another blow."
"This time, the veteran goes for the creatures head. Emboldened by liquor, the strike find its target knocking the creature to the flagstones."
"Lost in his stupor, the Veteran keeps hitting the beast, over and over. Until the shadows it was made of shatters and the darkness in the shrine, finally, fades..."
"*The Storyteller looks at you, silent now*"
<So he drinks to overcome his issues?>[Coping]
<So if that is the veteran, what is your story?>[Storytellers' introduction]


[Coping]
"Yes, we all have ways to overcome the challenges we face. His is drinking..."
"There are many ways for us to face our struggles *The Storyteller holds up their Journal*"
"And I'm guessing even you have your own way to face all of it."
"Although I may be unable to assist you directly, I hope this will be of some use to you. *The Storyteller hands you a small charm*" {recieveItem}
"I should be on my way, the climb waits for no one."
*END* 


[Disbelief]
"*The Storyteller recognize the look on your face* Ah! One who has not come to know the horrors out there?"
"In our path through this tower, these, Wardens, as we call them, come to test us."
"Horrific beings, powerful enough to cut many of us down without as much as second look"
"If you haven't met one yet, I hope you never do. Take this, as it will help you when when the time comes. *The Storyteller hands you a small charm*"{recieveItem}
"And I think this story is too... long for you for now, and I'll tell you it some other time. But for now, It is time to say goodbye. I hope we meet again, friend."
*END* 

[Storytellers' introduction]
"You're... asking about me?"
<Yes>[Introduction Cont]
<No, I'm just messing with you and I'll be taking my leave>[NoProgressEnd]

[Introduction Cont]
"I'm the Storyteller, I'm one of the many climbers of the Tower." 
"I collect the stories of all of us, and spread them. I gather and build these stories..." 
"...to make sure that we don't forget anyone's journey, or anyone's struggles through out this tower"
"I want to bring those stories with me outside of this tower when I reach the top... *They look longingly at the ceiling*" 
"...Whatever is up there, informing everyone about our struggles..."
"... so we can remember those that have fallen."
<*Nod* Tell me more about your story.>[Further Cont]
<Those that have fallen?>[Fallen]

[Further Cont]
"More about me? Other climbers rarely ask about me, so I don't really know what to say"
"*They open their journal* Well I have... climbed this tower for a long time..."
"The pages of my journals talk more about others than about meyself so I know that I've met so many fantastic people in here"
"As well as the wardens that keep pulling me back down, over and over again."
"But I will climb to the end of this tower, and I'll tear it down and free everyone in here."
<I just want to get out.>[Tower will Tell]
<That is a big goal...>[RestStart]

[Fallen]
"The Fallen is everyone I haven't met for a long time, who's story has been curt short."
"Either they got to the top or they... gave up." 
"Staying in the lobby, or trenched up in a safe space of the tower never to be found"
"Or they are gone, entirely... *They look down at the floor*"
<...>[Silence]
<Gone entirely?>[Gone]

[Silence]
"Sometimes, a fallen appears again, but it's rare that they get out of their pits."
"This is why I record their stories, so everyone fallen on their journey."
"... is still remembered, treasured and at least, here. And if they return they too can remember who they were."
<That is commendable.>[RestStart]

[Gone]
"Yes, a tragedy, when they fade away within the tower itself. Gone forever..."
"This is why I record their stories, so everyone that falls on their journey"
"... is still remembered, treasured and at least, here, somehow."
<A noble goal.>[RestStart]

[Tower will Tell]
"Only the Tower can tell if you can succeed in that goal."
"Let me help your story at it's infancy. *They hand you a small charm*"{recieveItem}
"It is not much, but, I hope it will help you in your journey to get out. Just like it helped me when I first came here."
"And I will have to... leave now then, the struggle up the tower has only just begun. I wish you good luck."
*END*

[RestStart]
"Thank you. The tower and its wardens will always stand in our path."
"But I guess that is our challenge to face on our journey forward." 
"Let's make camp together for the day. That way, one of us can keep guard while the other rests, so that we can both refill our strength."
<That does sound like a good plan.>[RestEnd]
<I just want to get out of here.>[Tower will tell]

[RestEnd]
"Good, feel free to rest then."{refillPotions}
