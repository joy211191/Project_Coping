"*You come across the Storyteller, sitting in the corner of the room and staring up at the ceiling*"
"*Their journal lies open on the floor next to them, their mask's shape twisted, with a sad smile on it*" 
<*Leave them be*>[NoProgressEnd]
<*Walk up to them*>[Approach]

[Approach]
"*As you approach the Storyteller, they looks up at you*"
"Ah, it's you..."
<It is, so why are you on the ground?>[On the ground]
<We meet again.>[Journal]

[On the ground]
"I just, ended up here"
<So what do you remember of the last time we met?>[Journal]

[Journal]
"I don't really remember much of... all that" 
"*They reach for their Journal and starts looking through the pages* Let me... remind myself..."
<I don't have time for this.>[Leave]
<I can wait.>[Stay]

[Stay]
*You sit there in silence as the Storyteller skim the pages of their book*
*After a short while, they stop skimming and start reading*
"So you are a new climber?"
<Still pretty new>[New]
<A lot of things have happened since then.>[Events]
<I'm starting to build a story.>[Story]

[Events]
"So nice for you, that events have unfurled... *They shake their head*"
"For me, the events have mostly torn me apart. *They manage a pained laugh*"
"Torn me apart... It feels like I'll fade..."
<I'll let your pity parade continue, alone.>[Leave]
<Let us... not do that.>[Keep on]

[Keep on]
"But how could I keep going here? The tower never ends, I feel like I will be here forever."
"I can't understand what is happening around me..."
<Let's stay till we are both ready>[Stay2]
<We will one day, but I have to go>[Leave]

[New]
"I understand, so not a lot to say about your journey then? *The storyteller stares through you*"
"*The storyteller curls up back against the wall, holding their head against their knees*
"You should go."
<I do have a story to tell.>[Story]
<I'll leave you then.>[Leave2]

[Story]
"A story... *The Storyteller laughs coldly as they grasp their head*"
"If my arms could write right now, I would love to hear it"
<If you could write right now?>[Arms]
<Wasn't your goal to record all the stories?>[Goal]

[Arms]
"It's my arms, they feel numb, I can barely turn a page, how would I hold a quill?"
"Much less take in what the story is and what you tell me. I just can't..."
<Point me to where I should write down the footnotes>[Assistance]
<I see... I'll stay here till we can jot it all down.>[Rested]
<I'll leave you in your pity.>[Leave]

[Assistance]
"*They turn a page in the journal, and point to it* Thank you, your help means a lot to me"
<*Write down your tale this far*>[Writing]

[Writing]
"*They smile at the pages as you start filling them and as you finish they reach for their bag*"
"*they pull out a ring from it and hands it to you* Thank you again... {recieveItem}
"I'll go over this now, try to... get an understanding of it"
"*They dissappear into your text, reading intensively*"
<...>[Leave2]

[Goal]
"It is, but there is no end to this tower. I'll just let the wardens come and take me!"
*The storyteller presses their face into their hands*
<There is an end, we just have to keep going!>[Fallen]
<*Leave them*>[Leave2]

[Fallen]
"I would love to just fade, to fall..."
<Let us... not do that>[Keep on]
<I'll stay here until we are both ready, okay?>[Stay2]
<Well, I'll leave you to it.>[Leave]

[Stay2]
"Stay till we are both ready? The tower has killed all our hope, our willingness to go on."
"That doesn't work, we can't just... go on. It just doesn't work."
"*they stare cathatonically into the ground*"
<*Stay and wait for them to get ready to leave*>[Rested]


[Rested]
"*The two of you sit in silence, for what feels like hours*...{refillPotions}
"... *maybe even days, until they struggle to their feet*"
"I'll be... fine now, let's take your story another time...I can't wait to hear it.
"*They slowly stumble through the room*"
*END*
 
[Leave]
"I... I see... *They drop their book and stare back at the ceiling*
