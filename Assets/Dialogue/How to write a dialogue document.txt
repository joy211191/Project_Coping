Normal text will be displayed as dialogue "spoken" by the NPC. 
A line in a dialogue document equates to a dialogue box in-game.
A line in the dialogue box in game equates to 33 characters. 
That means that the dialogue box can contain a total of 69 characters.
Please note that words that cause the total number of characters to exceed 
the maximum length of a line(23 characters) will appear on the next line.
To prevent this try to keep lines short if not count the characters yourself.
NOTE: This is based on the Arial font in size 36 and the current screensize. 
If the font or the size of either the screen or font is changed,
please recalculate and update this passage.

Use less than(<) and greater than(>) to assign text as a dialogue option.
Each Dialogue option needs to be put on a new line and be followed by a flag.

Use *END* to assign an end to the conversation.

Use brackets([ and ]) to create a flag. Example: [Example Flag]
Flags needs to be put after a dialogue option and the line before where that option leads.
There can be no duplicate flag names. Use descriptive names for readability.
A flag cannot be followed by a dialogue option. Only 
There can be no empty lines between dialogue text and dialogue options or flags and dialogue text.

When writing please separate sections with two empty lines.


See following example:

Hello! I have some dialogue that is read from a .txt file now! Cool! Now they just need to make it more modular.
I can also have numerous rows of text. This is starting to look like something!
