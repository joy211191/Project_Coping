Normal text will be displayed as dialogue "spoken" by the NPC. 

Use less than(<) and greater than(>) to assign text as a dialogue option.
Each Dialogue option needs to be put on a new line and be followed by a flag.

Use *END* to assign an end to the conversation.

Use brackets([ and ]) to create a flag. Example: [Example Flag]
Flags needs to be put after a dialogue option and the line before where that option leads.
There can be no duplicate flag names. Use descriptive names for readability.
A flag cannot be followed by a dialogue option. Only 
There can be no empty lines between dialogue text and dialogue options or flags and dialogue text.


See following example:

Hello! I have some dialogue that is read from a .txt file now! Cool! Now they just need to make it more modular.
I can also have numerous rows of text. This is starting to look like something!
