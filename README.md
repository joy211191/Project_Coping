# Project_Coping
Prototyping course
This is the project for our Prototyping course for Master's Degree.

The game is related to coping mechanisms and how they affect one's health. The game is still under development and will take time to flesh out completely.
It is a 2-D side scrolling action-hack'n'slash game with a dark environment that is basically the ideology of how one deals with their problems with the help of coping mechanisms
